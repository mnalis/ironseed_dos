HI
1       ENTER THE ^LIGHT^, FOR WE ARE THE ^CHILDREN^ OF THE ^SUN^.  LIGHT REVEALS MUCH, AND THE LIGHT OF THE SUN REVEALS ALL.

BYE
2       WALK SWIFTLY THROUGH THE DARKNESS, AND RETURN SOON TO THE LIGHT.

VOID DWELLERS
5       DID THEY SEND YOU HERE?  THEY CARE ONLY ABOUT GOSSIP...THEY DO NOT TRADE IN REAL KNOWLEDGE.  YOU CAN TALK WITH THEM IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WHO JUST DESTROYED WHAT PLANET.  WHEN YOU ARE READY FOR THE TRUE SEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE, TALK TO US.

D'PANK
6       THAT WOULD BE US.  WE ARE THE ^CHILDREN^ OF THE ^SUN^, THE GATHERERS OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THE WALKERS OF THE LIGHT.

SENGZHAC
7       ^HE^ ARE AMONG THE OLDEST AND WISEST OF THE RACES IN THIS SECTION OF THE GALAXY.  HE GUARDS SOMETHING KNOWN BY MOST AS THE ^GOD'S EYE^.

GUILD
8       THE GUILD SEEK NOT KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSE...ONLY PROFIT IN IT.  THEY ARE TRICKY.  BE WARRY IN YOUR DEALINGS WITH THEM AND IN THE DEALS THAT YOU ACCEPT FROM THEM.

PHADOR MOCH
9       THEY ARE NOT A RACE WORTHY OF NOTE.  THEY ARE MUCH TOO OFFENSIVE AND VILE...MAYBE EVEN, A DARK RACE.

ERMIGEN
10      THEY ARE A STRONG MILITARY RACE.  THIER SHIPS ARE BETTER SHIELDED THAN ANY IN THIS SECTOR.  IT IS EVEN RUMORED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD A ^TEMPORAL ANCHOR^.

QUAI PA'LOI
11      THEY ARE QUITE AN ADVANCED RACE, BUT THEY HAVE AN ODD FACINATION WITH SMALL ODD DEVICES.  THEY HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO TRADE LARGE AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS FOR WHAT AMOUNTS TO A FEW SMALL PLASMA COUPLERS.

PAI ALOI
12      THEY ARE A SMALL FACTION OF QUAI PA'LOI WHO ARE CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE SQUANDERING THEIR RESOURCES BY TRADING THEM WITH OTHER RACES.  THEY ARE TRYING TO GAIN SUPPORT IN THEIR COUNSELS, BUT THEY ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THE ^Q'OOUL^ JUST YET.

Q'OOUL
13      AS THE HEAD FACTION OF THE QUAI PA'LOI, THEY SET THE POLICIES AS FAR AS TRADE AND ALIEN RELATIONS ARE CONCERNED.  THE ^PAI ALOI^ ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR POLICIES, BUT THAT IS THEIR PROBLEM.

ICON
14      THE ICON ARE RARELY SEEN AND NEVER HEARD.  THEY SEEM CONTENT TO STAY ON THEIR HOMEWORLD, WHEREEVER THAT IS, UNLESS ODD EVENTS DRAW THEM OUT.  IT IS RUMORED THAT THE GUILD HAS SOME CONTACT WITH THEM, BUT THEY TEND TO BE QUIET ABOUT THEIR
14      RELATIONS.  THAT IS, UNLESS YOU NAME THE RIGHT PRICE.

TITERIAN
15      THE TITERIAN ARE ALSO SEEKERS OF KNOWLEDGE, BUT THEY DO NOT SEEK THEIR KNOWLEDGE FROM THE SUN.  THEY SEEK IT IN SOMETHING THEY CALL QUANTUM PROBABILITIES.

YLINTHLIXYMN AARD
16      WE HAVE NOT SENSED THEIR LIGHT.

SCAVENGERS
17      THEY ARE A NUSNACE, BUT THEY ARE NOT A DANGER.  JUST KEEP AN EYE ON THEM AND THEY CAN BE AVOIDED.

MALZATOIR
19      THE MALZATOIR ARE VERY ADVANCED, BUT THEY ARE CONTENT TO STAY IN THEIR OWN SYSTEM.

****
20      THE ****, ALSO KNOWN AS THE NAMELESS ONES, ARRIVED SOON AFTER AN ODD STELLAR OCCURANCE.  THEY APPEARED TO BE SCIENTISTS, BUT THEIR EXPERIMENTS SOON ESCALATED.  THEY BEGAN BUILDING AWESOME ^DEVICES^.  THEY USED THEIR DEVICES TO CONTROL THE OTHER   
20      RACES AND SPREAD THEIR POWER.  FORTUNATELY, THE ^KENDAR^ DISCOVERED A ^SECRET^, AND THEY CORNERED AND DEFEATED THE ****.

DERRAAK
22      HE IS A PIRATE WHO OPERATES NEAR TRADE CENTERS.  HE SEEMS TO ATTACK AT RANDOM AND HE ALWAYS TAKES TAKES ODD TECH ITEMS.  HE SEEMS TO ATTACK ALL RACES EQUALLY EXCEPT FOR THE TITERIANS.  THEY SEEM TO KNOW HOW TO WARD HIM OFF.

TROJAN GATE
23      WE HAVE SEEN THEM...THERE ARE MANY, BUT THEY ARE NOT ILLUMINATED PROPERLY FOR US TO GUESS THEIR FUNCTION.

MONKS
24      WE HAVE HEARD OF THEM, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO FIND THEM.

HOMEWORLD
25      OUR WORLD, TALPARRA, IS DEEP AND WARM.  THE CANYONS NEAR THE SUN ARE ^BREATHTAKING^ AND ^INSPIRING^ TO ALL THOSE WHO SEEK LIGHT.  NEAR US IS A ^PLANET^ WHICH GLOWS WITH LIGHT.  WE WISH TO EXAMINE ITS LIGHT, BUT WE ARE ^BLINDED^.

TRADE
26      AH, KNOWLEDGE ALSO SPRINGS FROM THE EXCHANGE OF GOODS.  SHOW US WHAT YOU HAVE, THAT WE MIGHT LEARN.

HALLIFAX
27      IT IS SOME TYPE OF A RITUAL...SO OLD THAT WE ARE NOT SURE ITS PERFORMERS EVEN REMEMBER ITS ORIGINAL INTENT.

SHUNT
29      THE SHUNT DRIVE IS A THEORETICAL SYSTEM, BUT WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A WORKING VERSION OF IT.

GODS EYE
31      WE HAVE HEARD VERY LITTLE OF IT.  THE GOD'S EYE IS A SMALL PLANETOID OR ASTEROID THAT IS DEEP IN SENGZHAC TERRITORY.  IT ISN'T LIKELY THAT YOU WILL EVER SEE IT BECAUSE THE SENGZHAC HAVE A STRANGE RELIGEOUS ATTACHMENT TO IT.  ANY SHIP THAT TRIES TO
31      APPROACH THE EYE IS DESTROYED.

THERMOPLAST
33      THAT IS INDEED AN INTERESTING IDEA.  IF WE HAD A SMALL DEVICE PROTECTED WITH THERMOPLAST, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEND IT INTO THE SUN TO ACHEIVE TRUE ENLIGHTENMENT.

CHILDREN
36      ALL COMES FROM THE ^SUN^...FROM DEEP WITHIN IT.  ALL ARE ITS CHILDREN, AND WE SEEK ^KNOWLEDGE^ IN THE ^LIGHT^.

LIGHT
37      THE LIGHT GUIDES US AND LEADS US TO ^KNOWLEDGE^.  SINCE THE SUN IS THE SOURCE OF THE LIGHT, THEN IT IS ALSO THE SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE.

KNOWLEDGE
38      YES, WE SEEK THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUN.  WE STRIVE TO ENTER INTO IT AND FIND THE INNER ^SOURCE^.

SOURCE
39      IT IS THE ^SEED^ FROM WHICH ALL LIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE GROWS.  KNOWLEDGE STEMS FROM THE SOURCE, AND IT FLOURISHES IN THE ^HEAT^ AND THE LIGHT.

SUN
40      THE SUN GIVES US WARMTH AND LIGHT.  FROM THE ^SOURCE^ DEEP WITHIN, WE GAIN ^KNOWLEDGE^.  ONE DAY, WE WILL ENTER THE SUN AND GAIN KNOWLEDGE DIRECTLY FROM THE ^SOURCE^.

SEED
41      THE SEED IS OF ^IRON^, BUT THERE IS MUCH MORE TO IT THAN CAN BE PLAINLY SEEN.

IRON
42      WE WISH TO KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE.  MAYBE WE WILL LEARN THIS WHEN WE REACH THE SOURCE.

HEAT
43      THE SUN IS VERY HOT.  THE HEAT KEEPS US FROM ENTERING INTO THE SUN.  WE TRAIN AND DISIPLINE OURSELVES TO WITHSTAND THE HEAT.  SO FAR NONE OF US HAVE BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO ENTER.

HE
44      WE REFER TO THE SENGZHAC AS HE BECAUSE THE SENGZHAC ARE A COLLECTIVE ENTITY, ONE BRAIN WITH MANY BODIES.  

ANCHOR
45      TEMPORAL ANCHORS ARE THE STRONGEST SHIELDS EVER BUILT.  THEY WERE INVENTED, ALONG WITH MANY OTHER INTERESTING ^DEVICES^, BY THE ^****^.  

DEVICES
46      THE ^****^ HAD MANY DEVICES...MOST OF THEM FAR MORE ADVANCED THAN ANY DEVICES THE OTHER RACES HAD.  THE DEVICES PURPOSES WERE TO MAKE THE **** STRONG AND THE REST OF THE RACES WEAK.  THAT IS WHY YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF THEIR DEVICES AROUND NOW.

KENDAR
47      IT WAS A TEMPORARY ALLIANCE OF ALL THE ESTABLISHED RACES IN THE AREA.  THE RACES KNEW THAT THEY WERE NO MATCH FOR THE ^DEVICES^ ALONE.

SECRET
48      IF WE KNEW, THEN IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH OF A SECRET.

BREATHTAKING
49      OH, I CAN FEEL THE HEAT AND THE LIGHT IN MY GILLS EVEN NOW.     

INSPIRING
50      YES.  WHENEVER I SEE THE VALLEYS OF THE SUN, I AM FLOODED WITH THE DESIRE TO CONTINUE DEEPER AND DEEPER...TO ENTER INTO IT...TO JOIN WITH IT...BUT OF COURSE, THEN I COME TO MY SENSES AND GO DEHYDRATE MY SORROWS IN A BOTTLE OF OXIDANTS.

PLANET
51      THE PLANET IS LOCATED AT *****.

BLINDED
52      THERE IS A SHIELD AROUND THE ^PLANET^ THAT KEEPS US FROM APPROACHING TO SEE IT.

GUILD
53      THE GUILD HAVE MADE A TERRIBLE ^MISTAKE^.  THEY HAVE DESTROYED ANOTHER ^RACE^.

MISTAKE
54      THEY HAVE DESTROYED THE HOME PLANET OF A SIENTIENT ^RACE^.  THEY ARE VERY UPSET, AND THEY WISH TO TRY TO REPOPULTE THE RACE.  UNFORTUNATELY, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY GENETIC ^MATERIAL^ TO USE AS A CLONING SEED.

RACE
55      THE RACE WAS KNOWN AS THE YLINTHLIXYMN, OR YILLERS FOR SHORT.

HI (AT START OF WAR)
56      ENTER THE ^LIGHT^, FOR WE ARE THE ^CHILDREN^ OF THE ^SUN^.  WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS SOMTHING HAPPENING WITH THE ^QUAI PA'LOI^.

QUAI PA'LOI
57      THEY HAVE GONE TO WAR WITH THEMSELVES.  THE PAI ALOI HAVE OVERTHROWN THE Q'OOUL.  EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE IN ^CHAOS^.

PAI ALOI
58      THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER THE QUAI PA'LOI HOMEWORLD, AND CANCELED FORMER ALL TRADE AGREEMENTS.

Q'OOUL
59      THEY RAN...I DON'T THINK THAT THEY EVEN LOOKED BACK.  I AM NOT SURE THAT THEY WILL EVEN ATTEMPT TO TAKE BACK THEIR RULE.

CHAOS
60      THE PAI ALOI ARE RADICAL EXTREMISTS.  THEY WERE ABLE TO BAND TOGETHER ON THE ISSUE OF NO OUTSIDE TRADING, BUT THEY CANNOT AGREE ON ANYTHING ELSE.  THERE IS BOUND TO BE MUCH INTERNAL FIGHTING...THE Q'OOUL COULD PROBABLY DEFEAT THEM IN A SINGLE SWOOP.

MATERIAL
61      IT IS HARD TO FIND ANY PRESERVED GENETIC MATERIAL FROM A DEAD RACE.  PERHAPS SOMEONE HAS KEPT SOME GENETIC ARCHIVES.

YILLERS
62      THEY WERE DESTROYED BY THE GUILD OVER A TRADE DISAGREEMENT.

QUAI PA'LOI
63      THE Q'OOUL HAVE FINALLY REGAINED CONTROL OF THE REALM.  UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NOT MUCH LEFT ON THEIR PLANET.  THE PAI ALOI'S INTERNAL FIGHTING DESTORYED MOST OF THE PLANETS RESOURCES.

PAI ALOI
64      THEIR LEADERS HAVE FLED...IT IS RUMORED THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW CAUSE TO BAND THEM TOGETHER.

Q'OOUL
65      THEY HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO TO TRY TO REESTABLISH THEIR NOW DYING WORLD.  IT IS SAD TO SEE SUCH AN ENLIGHTENED RACE FALL INTO DARKNESS.

ERMIGEN
66      WE HAVE HEARD THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DESTROYED...WE ARE NOT SURE IF IT IS TRUE, BUT WE CERTAINLY WISH TO SEEK LIGHT IN THE MATTER.

ERMIGEN
67      THE STORY YOU HAVE BROUGHT US ABOUT THEIR SHIP HITTING THE SUN IS VERY UNLIKELY.  THE ERMIGEN HAD VERY RELIABLE EQUIPMENT AND PILOTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY THEIR OWN ^WILL^.

WILL
68      WHY THEY WOULD DO SUCH A THING, WE CANNOT SEE.  MAYBE YOU CAN FIND LIGHT ELSEWHERE.

HI  (WANT PROBOT)
69      WELCOME BACK TO THE LIGHT...WE HAVE HEARD THAT YOU HAVE A ^PROBOT^ THAT HAS A STRONG THERMAL SHIELDING...MAYBE STRONG ENOUGH TO ENTER THE SUN.  WE WOULD BE WILLING TO OFFER YOU SOMETHING...ANYTHING FOR IT.

PROBOT
70      ARE YOU WILLING TO SELL US THE THERMAL PROBOT?  YOU CAN NAME YOUR PRICE...

71      WONDERFUL, WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT FROM US...A THERMATURGE!!!  THAT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.  THERMATURGES ARE MUCH TOO DANGEROUS.  WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NO THERMATURGE, NO PROBOT."  WE MUST HAVE THAT PROBOT...GIVE IT TO US...PLEASE!!!  THE SUN BECONS.
71      THE SEED..THE SUN..THE SUNSEED..THE IRONSEED..WE MUST HAVE IT.  OKAY, OKAY, WE WILL MEET YOUR DEMANDS.  WE HAVE WAITED FOR SO LONG TO ENTER THE SUN.  WE NO LONGER NEED IT TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST THE SCAVENGERS.  WHAT HARM COULD YOU DO WITH ONLY
71      ONE THERMATURGE.. ..THANK YOU FOR THE TRANSACTION.  WE MUST NOW BEGIN PREPARING FOR OUR JOURNEY INTO THE SUN.  GOOD-BYE.

72      FINE, WE WILL WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO ALLOW US PASSAGE INTO THE SUN.

HI (END)
73      I AM SORRY, BUT WE ARE TOO BUSY TO TALK...WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF EXPLORING THE SUN AND EXAMINING THE LIGHT...GOOD-BYE.

SCAVS
74      WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF THEM.

SCAVS
75      THEY ARE BECOMING BOLD, BUT THEY ARE STILL NOT TO DANGEROUS.  THEY WILL NEVER GET NEAR US AS LONG AS WE HAVE OUR THERMATURGE.

SCAVS
76      THE SCAVENGERS HAVE BECOME VERY DANGEROUS...SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THEM.  WE ARE HAVE TO USE OUR THERMATURGE TO FEND THEM OFF.

SCAVS
77      THEY HAVE STOPPED ATTACKING.  WE THINK THAT THEY MUST BE GATHERING SOMEWHERE...TO WHAT END, WE ONLY HOPE THAT THEY ARE NOT PLANNING OUR DOOM.

SCAVS
78      YES, WE HEARD THAT YOU HAD DESTROYED THOSE BOTS OF GREAT DARKNESS...WELL DONE.

THERMATURGE
79      IT IS A VERY POWERFUL WEAPON...IT BREATHES FIREY DEATH...EVEN IN THE DEPTHS OF SPACE.

THEMATURGE
80      WE NEED IT TO DEFEND AGAINST THE SCAVENGERS.
