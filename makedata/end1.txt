When we had defeated what we thought 
was the last of the scourge a sea of
scavenger ships appeared through God's
Eye! The fleet we had destroyed was
only a small fraction of the armada
that now poured from the other side of
space.
 Ships from every empire threw
themselves into the frey. Gouts of firey
death rained down from every ship, hot
steel boiling off into the vacuum. Each 
of us said a prayer. Turning the ship 
about we sent the Ironseed head long 
into battle. There was no hope of 
survival. We were struck by a full salvo
from a Scavenger incorporator and all
seemed lost.

We waited for the death shot but it
never came. All firing stopped and
for a moment silence fell across the 
ship. 
 A great swirling void as red as blood
enveloped the Eye. Gravimetric readings 
went off the scale. Science couldn't  
explain it. Space itself was being wrent 
apart. Angry bolts of energy lashed out 
through the wall of ships and debris, 
vast tracks of empty space left in their 
wake. The dark fleet was collapsing back 
into the wake of the void!
 Ships struggled to break free. There 
was no escape as the last of them fell 
into the void. 
 As the last ship fell out of sight we 
received a message...
...from the scavenger overmind.


 The swirling red of the void receeded 
and brightened to a glowing center.
The intense psychic energy released
must be responsible for what we saw 
next. A great pair of human hands
appeared in the space around the void
and a voice spoke, warm and comforting.
"We are the Monks, the Keepers of 
Hallifax, the Eye of God. We see all
things. This day we saw great evil
about to be done. The Scavengers are
with us now. They were ours from the
beginning.
 You brought us the prize for this 
we grant you what lies beyond the Eye."
A great blue sphere came through the 
light and the brightness vanished along
with the Eye itself.
