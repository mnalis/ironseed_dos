HI
1       HELLO AGAIN.  WE HAVE REGAINED OUR HOME.  YOU DESERVE A REWARD FOR YOUR HELP.  WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE OF OUR HOMEWORLD LEFT, BUT THE PAI ALOI HAVE DESTROYED ALMOST EVERYTHING...THE ENVIRONMENT, THE INDUSTRIES, THE QUI BALL STADIUMS,
1       EVERYTHING.  I GUESS THAT IS NOT YOUR CONCERN THOUGH.  WELL, THE ONLY POTENTIALLY USEFUL OBJECT WE CAN FIND IS THIS ARTIFACT HERE.  WE ARE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES, BUT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

BYE
2       WE ARE SORRY THAT WE COULD NOT HELP YOU MORE.

HELP
3       WE CANNOT ASK YOU FOR ANY MORE HELP.  WE WILL HAVE TO WORK THINGS OUT FOR OURSELVES.

HI
4       HELLO.  WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE MUCH HELP TO YOU.  OUR WAR RECOVERY EFFORT HAS NOT BEEN VERY FRUITFUL.  OUR PLANET IS IN BAD SHAPE.

RACES
5       WE DO NOT HAVE TIME TO GOSSIP.

QUAI PA'LOI
6       WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN CONSIDERING THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR PLANET.

PAI ALOI
7       THEY LEFT THIS PLACE IN A WRECK.

Q'OOUL
8       WE WON, BUT EXACTLY WHAT DID WE WIN IS THE QUESTION.

HOMEWORLD
25      IT IS A WRECK.

TRADE
26      WE WISH THAT WE COULD, BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING WORTH TRADEING...BESIDES, WE ARE TOO BUSY RECONSTRUCTING OUR PLANET TO PLAY WITH NEW TECH.
